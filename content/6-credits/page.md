Many people and sites have helped to gather the information condensed here. I'm not able to remember and list all of them, but this is a try:

## Installation

- [Instruction on how to use repos](https://www.qownnotes.org/installation/arch.html) from openSUSE's build service by Patrizio Bekerle
- [Instructions on how to compile](https://github.com/plaurent/gnustep-build) the GNUstep frameworks with libobjc2 on Ubuntu/Debian by Patryk Laurent and a [very helpful and extensive guide](http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/Building_GNUstep_under_Debian_FreeBSD) on compiling and installing by Andreas Fink


## Special thanks to

- Fred Kiefer for numerous mails of patient help to understand and fix some bits and pieces and maintaining [gnustep-gui (AppKit)](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-gui) of course.
- David Chisnall for creating and maintaining [libobjc2](https://github.com/gnustep/libobjc2).
- Riccardo Canalicchio and Alessandro Sangiuliano for creating the initial [Rik.theme](https://github.com/AlessandroSangiuliano/rik.theme) which was important to reach out for a good looking GNUstep next to the Nesedah theme from the [Etoilé project](http://etoileos.com/) (yes, that's been given up).
- Bertrand Dekoninck who did great pioneering graphics work on creating an appealing GNUstep working environment and [GNUstep themes](https://github.com/BertrandDekoninck/Sombre).
- Niels Grewe for writing [DBusKit and DBusMenu](https://github.com/gnustep/libs-dbuskit/) - great stuff, hoping for more fixes to come!
- Riccardo Mottola for maintaing numerous [GNUstep apps](http://www.nongnu.org/gap/).

Generally speaking to the [GNUstep community](http://gnustep.org/information/gethelp.html) as a whole as there are many friendly and helpful people. Thank you!
